## I. Framework Introduction

WSXJS is a modern Web Components framework that focuses on JSX syntax and TypeScript support, completely zero dependency on React, dedicated to the ultimate development experience of native WebComponent capabilities.

- **Core Philosophy**: WebComponent + JSX + TypeScript, ultimate type safety and development efficiency.
- **wsx files**: Web Component with JSX, using `.wsx` extension, equivalent to TSX syntax for WebComponent.
- **Self-validation**: The examples directory is the main scenario for wsx system self-validation.

## II. Project Structure

- packages/core: Core capabilities (WebComponent abstract base class, JSX factory, auto-registration, style management, logging, etc.)
- packages/vite-plugin: Vite plugin, automatically handles `.wsx` files, JSX factory injection, TypeScript compilation, hot reload
- packages/eslint-plugin: Dedicated ESLint rules (render-method-required, no-react-imports, web-component-naming)
- packages/examples: wsx component demonstrations and self-validation, GitHub Pages deployment entry

## III. Core APIs and Mechanisms

### 1. WebComponent Abstract Base Class
- Enforces `render()` method implementation, supports JSX syntax
- Lifecycle hooks (onConnected, onDisconnected, onAttributeChanged)
- Style isolation and management (Shadow DOM + CSS-in-JS)

### 2. JSX Factory
- Zero dependency self-developed JSX factory, supports all standard HTML attributes, events, Fragment
- Vite plugin automatically injects h/Fragment, no manual import needed

### 3. autoRegister Decorator
- Automatically registers custom elements, supports custom tagName, automatic PascalCase to kebab-case conversion
- Prevents duplicate registration, supports prefix

### 4. Style Management
- Supports CSS-in-JS, Constructable StyleSheets, Shadow DOM isolation
- Compatible with external CSS files (`?inline` import)

### 5. Logging System
- createLogger/WSXLogger, supports levels, namespaces, debug mode

## IV. Examples Integration and Self-validation

- The examples directory is the real demonstration and self-validation scenario for the wsx system
- Components (such as Button, ColorPicker, ButtonGroup) are all wsx files, fully demonstrating core capabilities
- Vite configuration integrates wsx-vite-plugin, supports `.wsx` hot reload and debugging
- Through pnpm workspace mechanism, examples depend on core/vite-plugin as local packages, supporting collaborative development

## V. Vite Plugin

- Automatically recognizes `.wsx` files, processes as tsx
- Automatically injects JSX factory (h/Fragment)
- Supports TypeScript, decorators, CSS-in-JS
- Compatible with hot reload and production builds

## VI. ESLint Plugin

- render-method-required: Enforces wsx components to implement `render()`
- no-react-imports: Prohibits wsx files from importing React
- web-component-naming: Enforces custom element naming conventions (with hyphen, non-reserved names)
- 100% unit test coverage, examples directory as real integration test scenario

## VII. CI/CD and Development Workflow

- GitHub Actions continuous integration: Automatic lint, typecheck, test, build, coverage, examples deployment
- Local development: pnpm dev/watch, examples directory hot reload collaborative validation
- Code quality assurance: Husky + lint-staged + Prettier + ESLint + Jest

## VIII. Best Practices and Future Plans

- Recommended to develop WebComponent mainly with wsx files, fully utilizing type and JSX advantages
- Examples directory continuously supplements new features and end-to-end tests
- Future plans: SSR, component composition patterns, advanced state management, performance monitoring, more built-in components, documentation site generation
